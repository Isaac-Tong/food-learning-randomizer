# Food Randomizer

## About The Project
An android/iOS app written in Flutter that displays random dishes and foods along with their corresponding cuisines. It works with the [Food Randomizer API](https://github.com/Isaac-Tong/getFood-REST-api), another project that I created that returns a JSON of a random food, which are stored in an updatable mongoDB ATLAS database. Images are feteched using [Bing cognitive services API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/bing-web-search-api/). Project is intended to help me develop backened, frontend, and UI design skills.

* Find a cheaper image API than Microsoft's cognitive services.
